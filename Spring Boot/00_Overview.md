## Programming Language vs Technology vs Framework

### What is Programming Language?
* Programming Language contains set of instructions / set of commands.
* Every Programming Language will follow set of Syntax / Rules.
* Using programming language we can develop:
    * Applications
    * Tools
    * Softwares
    * Technologies
    * Frameworks

### What is Technology?
* Technology is a software which is developed by using Programming Language.
* Technologies are used to simplify our task.
* By using Technologies we can develop several types of applications.
* Example:
    * Servlets
    * JSP
    * JDBC

### What is Framework?
* Framework is a semi developed software.
* Framework provides common logics required for application development.
* Framework provides re-usable components.
* To avoid duplicate code / common logic implementation Frameworks came into picture.
    * Project = Business Logics + Common Logics
* Frameworks provides common logics required for the project so that we can focus only on Business Logic Development.
* Framework will improve developers productivity (we cna do more work in less time).
* Example:
    * Java -> Hibernate, Struts, Spring
    * .Net -> WCF
    * Python -> DJango, Flask
    * Salesforce -> Lightening

`Note`: Frameworks will be developed using Programing Languages only.

### Boiler Plate Code / Redundant Code?
* If we are  writing same code fo multiple times then it is called as Boiler Plate / Redundent Code.

### Application Architecture?
1. Monolith AArchitecture
2. Microservices Architecture

### Monolith Architecture
* Developing all requirements as one application.
* Maintenance will become difficult.
* For small change, whole project re-deploy.
* Single point of failure.

### Microservice Architecture
* It is an architectural design pattern to develop applications.
* Loosely coupled APIs
* Easy Maintenance
* Easy Deployments
* No single point of failure

### Spring Framework
* Spring Framework is called as application development framework.
* By using spring framework we can develop end to end application.
* Spring is free and open source.
* Spring Framework is developed in modular fashion.
* Note: Spring Framework means collection of modules.
* Spring is loosely coupled framework.
* Spring is very flexible framework. It will not force to use all modules.
* Spring is versatile framework
    * Can be integrated with any other framework available in the market.
    * Compatible with other frameworks.

### Spring Modules
1. Spring Core
2. Spring Context
3. Spring JDBC
4. Spring ORM
5. Spring AOP
6. Spring Web MVC
7. Spring Security
8. Spring Social
9. Spring Batch
